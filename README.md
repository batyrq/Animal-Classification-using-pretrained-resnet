All right, here's a README and project description for your animal detection project using a pre-trained ResNet model.

# Animal Detection with Pre-trained ResNet

-----

## Project Description

This project focuses on **animal detection** using a **deep learning approach** with a pre-trained **ResNet-18 model**. The goal is to classify images of various animals, leveraging the power of transfer learning to achieve high accuracy with a relatively smaller dataset.

The solution uses the `animals-detection-images-dataset` from Kaggle, specifically the `train` folder, for training and validation. A custom `ImageDataset` class is implemented to handle data loading and preprocessing, including essential transformations like resizing, random flipping, color jitter, and normalization. The dataset is split into training and validation sets to properly evaluate the model's performance.

The core of the model is a pre-trained ResNet-18, a convolutional neural network architecture known for its effectiveness in image classification tasks. The final fully connected layer of the ResNet model is replaced to adapt it for the specific number of animal classes in this dataset. The model is trained using the **Adam optimizer** and **Cross-Entropy Loss**, and its performance is monitored through training and validation accuracy over several epochs.

This project demonstrates a practical application of transfer learning for image classification, offering a robust and efficient way to build an animal detection system.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python and `pip` installed. Then, you can install the required libraries using the `requirements.txt` file (if you create one) or by installing them individually:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision scikit-learn Pillow
```

-----

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **`animals-detection-images-dataset`** available on Kaggle. Specifically, the images from the **`train`** folder are utilized. This dataset contains various animal images, categorized into different subdirectories, with each subdirectory representing a distinct animal class.

You'll need to download this dataset and place the `train` folder in a location accessible by your project (e.g., `/kaggle/input/animals-detection-images-dataset/train` if running on Kaggle or a similar path locally).

## Usage

1.  **Clone the repository (if applicable):**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_project.git
    cd your_project
    ```

2.  **Download the dataset:**
    Ensure the `animals-detection-images-dataset` is downloaded from Kaggle and the `train` folder is correctly placed as `/kaggle/input/animals-detection-images-dataset/train` or updated to your local path in the `dataset` initialization.

3.  **Run the training script:**
    The provided Python script (`main.py` or similar, containing the code you shared) will handle data loading, model training, and validation.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Model Architecture

The project utilizes a pre-trained **ResNet-18** model from the `torchvision.models` library. ResNet (Residual Network) is a powerful convolutional neural network that addresses the vanishing gradient problem through the use of residual connections.

The pre-trained weights, learned from a large dataset like ImageNet, provide a strong foundation for image feature extraction. The final fully connected layer of the ResNet-18 model is replaced with a new linear layer (`nn.Linear`) that outputs the number of classes present in your animal dataset. This allows the model to classify your specific animal categories while benefiting from the rich feature representations learned during the pre-training phase.

```python
from torchvision.models import resnet18
import torch.nn as nn

# Load pre-trained ResNet-18
model = resnet18(pretrained=True)

# Replace the final fully connected layer for the number of animal classes
num_classes = len(dataset.class_to_idx) # This would be determined from your dataset
model.fc = nn.Linear(model.fc.in_features, num_classes)
```

-----

## Training

The model is trained using the following configuration:

  * **Optimizer:** Adam (`torch.optim.Adam`)
  * **Learning Rate:** `1e-3`
  * **Loss Function:** Cross-Entropy Loss (`nn.CrossEntropyLoss`)
  * **Epochs:** 10 (as in the provided code)
  * **Batch Size:** 32

The training loop iterates through the specified number of epochs. In each epoch:

  * The model is set to training mode (`model.train()`).
  * Batches of images and labels are fed to the model.
  * The loss is calculated, and gradients are backpropagated.
  * The optimizer updates the model's weights.
  * Training loss and accuracy are reported.

After each training epoch, the model is evaluated on a separate validation set:

  * The model is set to evaluation mode (`model.eval()`).
  * Predictions are made without gradient calculation (`torch.no_grad()`).
  * Validation accuracy is reported to assess the model's generalization performance.

## Results

The training output will display the loss and accuracy for each epoch on both the training and validation sets. An example of the output format is:

```
Epoch 1 | Loss: 1633.2952 | Train Acc: 28.53%
Validation Acc: 33.25%

Epoch 2 | Loss: 1264.8941 | Train Acc: 40.82%
Validation Acc: 39.70%

Epoch 3 | Loss: 1100.5082 | Train Acc: 46.96%
Validation Acc: 46.37%

Epoch 4 | Loss: 956.6294 | Train Acc: 52.53%
Validation Acc: 46.68%

Epoch 5 | Loss: 838.4260 | Train Acc: 57.64%
Validation Acc: 48.54%

Epoch 6 | Loss: 756.8016 | Train Acc: 60.95%
Validation Acc: 51.60%

Epoch 7 | Loss: 685.9907 | Train Acc: 63.98%
Validation Acc: 49.67%

Epoch 8 | Loss: 596.5497 | Train Acc: 67.99%
Validation Acc: 49.69%

Epoch 9 | Loss: 542.5117 | Train Acc: 70.58%
Validation Acc: 52.70%

Epoch 10 | Loss: 478.2218 | Train Acc: 73.52%
Validation Acc: 51.84%
```

Observe the trend in both training and validation accuracy to understand how well the model is learning and generalizing. Ideally, both accuracies should increase and stabilize, with the validation accuracy indicating the model's performance on unseen data.
